<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Usman Momohsani is my name, from Nigeria Edo state born january 5th 1988. 
  I have always found nature fascinating as a child growing up in the village.
  With the streams, hills, vegetations and other natural endowments like the traditions, food, art etc. 
  Realizing that nature and art play a big role in tourism, i choose to go into web design development, where
 i can design beautiful website full of art and traditional platform, where we can do reserch about our culture.</p>

<p>I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry, and completed it with Honours from Ambrose Alli University,
  Ekpoma, Edo State, Nigeria. After the completion of my studies, I did one-year mandatory National Youth Service Corps. 
  (N.Y.S.C.) at Phalga local government in Rivers state</p>

<p>where I served as a chemistry teacher in Government secondary school, Phalga. During my service year,  
  I was in Environmental Protection and Sanitation Group as my ‘Community Development Service group (CDS)’. 
  Being a member of this group, I impacted to the community by sensitization on the need to keep our environment  
  clean for a healthy living and to promote and sustain healthy environment.</p>
